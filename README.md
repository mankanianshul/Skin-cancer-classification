## Project: Skin cancer image classification

The aim of this project is to classify the skin cancer images into its types. 

The model classifies the images into the three types of skin cancer -

1. Basal 
2. Melanoma  
3. Squamous 

 This project uses transfer learning methods using Inception v3 architecture for image classification.

## Required Libraries

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Numpy

##To run the project just change the directories of the images in the code to your directory run "train.py" to train the model and then run "run.py" file
